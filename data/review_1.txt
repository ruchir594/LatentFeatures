All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent and later Two Face  he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime- fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.
