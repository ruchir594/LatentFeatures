German businessman Oskar Schindler does not hesitate to use Jewish slave labor in his new factory. A member of the Nazi party, Schindler is essentially apolitical but knows how to deal with the bureaucracy and those in power to get what he wants. Over time, he is deeply affected by the treatment of Jews and begins to take steps to protect the 1500 or so people who work for him. He convinces the authorities to build a new factory where the employees are interned and goes out of his way to hire those who face the wrath of the camp commandant, Amon Goth. When the camp is closed, he arranges for "his" Jews to be transferred to a new factory in Czechoslovakia. When the train carrying the women is diverted to Auschwitz, he races to have them freed using a part of his fortune to have them released to him. By the end of the war, Schindler has lost everything but has saved the lives of over 1000 of his employees.
