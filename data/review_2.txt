Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the US government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.

The "real" villain reveals him / her self in an absurd Act 3 "twist" that's followed by a narrated flashback the same one that leads to Bane CRYING. and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust / held into his side.

After the 2nd lame Bats/ Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd " action sequence " consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird- looking clunky flying thing. that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky "plane" could not have possibly eluded.
